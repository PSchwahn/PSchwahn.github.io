title:  "The bizzare jungle of curvature conventions"
---
If you're not into Riemannian geometry, this post will probably bore you. But I needed some place to vent, and here we are.

In my daily business, I often encounter various objects and operators derived from curvature tensors. I used to be dimly aware that different traditions or schools of differential geometry have different opinions on how the curvature of a connection should be written down.

But only after I spent some time in early December collecting some notes on how different authors define certain curvature-related objects (I was tired of having to redo the same time-consuming and sign-error-prone calculations to translate from the working definition of Author A to that of Author B, not to mention Authors C, D and E) did it really dawn on me how deep the rabbit hole goes.

This is what inspired the following Mathstodon post:

Let me elaborate on that.

But who am I to complain. The situation is even worse for people in Lorentzian geometry where there's also two sign conventions for the correct signature of the metric tensor...
