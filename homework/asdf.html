I didn't think the "happy sachiko" (?) ritual would actually work, but here I am... In hindsight, I should have consulted J.<br><br>

This has got to be some sort of cruel joke. My phone is dead and every kind of social media seems to be down as well. But Github works for some reason??<br><br>

I doubt what I'm connected to is actually the internet. But I have to hope that it is. If I can't get out, at least my thoughts might.<br><br>

This place is hostile. I've no time for details, but you do not want to be here. DO NOT FOLLOW ME.<br><br>

I gotta move. Hope I can post again later. If not, well.<br><br>

=======================================================================<br><br>

Been scavenging for food and drink. Found some unopened bottles of Macedonian, but even if uncontaminated, I'm not willing to drink it.<br><br>

My sanity is rapidly deteriorating. Obviously, I'm not superhuman. I have met some... things... not sure if they are just "locals" or remnants of other visitors who have lost theirs. I can scarely imagine what staying here for a week would do to someone, even if they manage to find food etc.<br><br>

People are probably not looking for me, since they think I'm in Fr*nce. But even if they did, I don't think anyone could help me.<br><br>

If I die here, do I wake up? In the worst case, I guess I haved lived fast and died young.<br><br>

Seems I have no choice but to head downstairs, even if it is dangerous. Arguably the worst premise to first-time the catacombs. I'll keep you posted if I make it.
