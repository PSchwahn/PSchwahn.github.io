# Talks with resources

* October 2025: [Slides]({{"/assets/cicm2025_slides.pdf" | relative_url}}) for a talk presenting our [formalization project](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-032-07021-0_18) on low-dimensional solvable Lie algebras at the _18th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics_ in Brasília.
* July 2025: A [SageMath Jupyter notebook]({{"/assets/Sage_LiE_Demo.ipynb" | relative_url}}) and accompanying [LiE files]({{"/assets/lie_demo.zip" | relative_url}}) used at a software demo (_Lie theory and branching in LiE and SageMath_) which I gave at the _Problem-Solving Workshop Computational Geometric Analysis_ at CUNY.
* December 2023: _[Minimal Submanifolds in Spheres]({{"/assets/minimal_submfds_in_spheres.pdf" | relative_url}})_. Notes for a lecture at a seminar on submanifolds in Stuttgart.
