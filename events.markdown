In October 2023 I co-hosted [*The Crazy World of Arthur L. Besse*, a workshop on Einstein manifolds](https://www.igt.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/workshop-einstein-2023/).

A month prior I co-organized a student seminar about tensors, the [*Sesquinar*](https://pnp.mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de/igt/eiserm/lehre/2023/Tensoren/).

Here is a list of recorded talks of mine:
